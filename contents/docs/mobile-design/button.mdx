## Overview

A "FAB" or "Floating Action Button" in Material Design (including Material 3) is a circular button that floats above the interface, often used for the primary action on a screen. Itâ€™s typically placed in the bottom-right corner of a mobile interface, but it can also be used in other locations depending on the design.
